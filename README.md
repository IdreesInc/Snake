## About Snake
Snake, programmed in TypeScript, stylized like an old LCD screen. Because why not?

## How to Play
### On a Computer
Just use the arrow keys and try not to hit yourself! (advice for life)

### On Mobile
Use the buttons on the bottom of the screen to maneuver the snake. The canvas should auto-resize to fit your screen, but please notify me if your buttons are cut off!

## How it Works
Updates the grid when the snake moves and collects food, draws the grid on the canvas. The canvas is then stylized like a LCD screen, because nostalgia.
